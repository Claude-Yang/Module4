        I am going to talk about my favorite band, Queen. The origins of queen date back to 1968, 
        when guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor started the group Smile while students in London. 
        A friend and follower of the band, Farrokh Bulsara, eventually joined the group in late 1970 and convinced 
        the members to change the name to Queen because of its “regal” quality and his abilit to design an adequate logo. 
        After going through a number of bass players, John Deacon joined in 1971 as the permanent fourth member of the group，
        which maintain this lineup for the next 20 years. Shortly after the release of their 1973 self-titled debut album, 
        Bulsara officially adopted his stage name, Freddie Mercury. In 1974, the group released two critically acclaimed albums, 
        Queen II and Sheer Heart Attack, each of which spawned a Top 10 hit in the UK with Sheer Heart Attack being their first commercial success in the US.
